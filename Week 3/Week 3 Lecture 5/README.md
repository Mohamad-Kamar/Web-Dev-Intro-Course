     - Item properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`, `order`, `align-self`
   - **Example:**
     ```css
     .container {
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: row;
       justify-content: space-between;
       align-items: center;

       margin: 10px;
     }
     ```
   - **Exercise:**
     - Task: Create a responsive navigation bar using Flexbox.
     - Students will design a navigation menu that adapts to different screen sizes.

4. **CSS Grid Layout (30 minutes)**
   - **Introduction to CSS Grid:**
     - What is CSS Grid and when to use it.
     - Basic concepts: grid container, grid items, grid lines, grid areas.
   - **Grid Properties:**
     - Container properties: `display: grid;`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, `grid-gap`
     - Item properties: `grid-column`, `grid-row`, `grid-area`
   - **Example:**
     ```css
     .grid-container {
       display: grid;
       grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
       grid-template-rows: auto;
       gap: 10px;
     }
     .grid-item {
       padding: 20px;
       background-color: lightgray;
     }
     ```
   - **Exercise:**
     - Task: Design a basic webpage layout using CSS Grid.
     - Students will create a layout with a header, sidebar, main content area, and footer.

5. **Responsive Design (20 minutes)**
   - **Principles of Responsive Design:**
     - Importance of responsive design in modern web development.
     - Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries.
   - **Using Media Queries:**
     - Example:
       ```css
       @media (max-width: 600px) {
         .container {
           flex-direction: column;
         }
       }
       ```
   - **Exercise:**
     - Task: Make a webpage responsive using media queries.
     - Students will adapt a webpage layout to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.

6. **CSS Transitions and Animations (20 minutes)**
   - **Introduction to Transitions:**
     - Transition properties: `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, `transition-delay`
     - Example:
       ```css
       .box {
         transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
       }
       .box:hover {
         background-color: coral;
       }
       ```
   - **Introduction to Animations:**
     - Keyframes and animation properties: `@keyframes`, `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-iteration-count`
     - Example:
       ```css
       @keyframes slideIn {
         from { transform: translateX(-100%); }
         to { transform: translateX(0); }
       }
       .animated-box {
         animation: slideIn 1s forwards;
       }
       ```
   - **Exercise:**
     - Task: Create a simple animation using keyframes.
     - Students will animate elements such as buttons or images to enhance user interaction.
